##Synopsis

This goal of this project is creating a camera slider controlled by a joystick. The slider basically built by combining the Arduino Uno, the EasyDriver Stepper Motor Driver and the Collision sensor switch module. This project is an good example of control the direction and speed of a stepper motor with Analog Joystick, Easy Driver and limit Switches.

##Connection

Here are the connections:

Pin 9 is connected to Steps pin on Easy Driver

Pin 8 is connected to Direction pin

Pin 10 is connected to MS1 pin

Pin 11 is connected to MS2 pin

Pin 12 is connected to SLEEP pin

Pin A0 connected to joystick X-axis

Pin 4 is connected to the joystick Key or switch pin
 
Pint 2 and 3 are connected to the OUT pin of the Limit Switches
 
The Ground and Voltage pins of the Easy Driver are connected to a 1 Amp 12V power supply.
 
We are also using a small breadboard to split the Ground and Voltage connections of the various devices
